# aes-code
This repository contains the code for the implementation of AES cipher in C.
In writing this code, I have relied on several books, youtube vidoes, and other aes code implmentation. 

Books:
- The Block Cipher Companion by Larr Knudsen
- Understanding Cryptography By Christof Paar
- Cryptography in C and C++ Second Edition by Michael Welschenbach.

P.S: For integrity purposes, I don't consider the code fully mine, since I was inspired by all the code links shown above. I'm simply posting my version of all the code I have seen, because I have made slight changes.
